1. The project is created as a blog;
2. Implemented by:
    * the ability to create articles;
    * possibility of user registration;
    * the user can change his name and avatar;
    * only the supervisor can create, delete, modify articles;
    * comments on each article;
    * like`s for each comment;
    * you can create or delete the same as when you click on the icon for a like or press on a button;
    * best comment on the article;
    * sort comments by creation time;
    * adding photos to the post via gem Paperclip;
    * adding an avatar from the user without Paperclip;
3. When designing the project was used gem 'Bootstrap'.
